# Some minimal Mutt settings, Gentoo-style.  These reflect the Gentoo
# predilection for maildir folders.
#
# Please don't add settings to this file to change other user
# preferences (such as colors), since those can be hard for a user to
# undo if their preference doesn't match yours!  For example, it is
# *impossible* currently in mutt to remove color settings from objects
# other than the index.
