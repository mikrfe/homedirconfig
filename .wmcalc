# wmcalc Configuration File
# Last Manual Update: 10/29/00

# General Notes: 
# * There must be a tab character '\t' between the variable name and
#   the value, not a series of spaces.
# * wmcalc is case sensitive when reading these variables.  Examine the 
#   wmcalc_g.h file for currently defined variables.

# The CalcStart variable is intended to allow the user to start a larger
# calculator for more complicated needs.  Everything after the tab '\t' 
# character is sent unmodified in a system() call, so anything you can type
# at the command prompt may be put here.

# The ImagChar variable allows the user to choose between 'i' and 'j' to 
# represent the sqrt(-1).  (Electrical Engineers (such as myself) use 'j' 
# rather than 'i.')
